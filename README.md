# C/C++ basic starter project with CMake and Conan for linux

Not the best starter C/C++ project in the world. In my opinion, CMake + Conan is a great combo for linux.

## Requirements:
- CMake.
- Python (For conan package manager).
- Ninja (you can change it to Makefiles if you want in scripts/configure.sh).

## Usage:

- Clone
- `./scripts/configure.sh` to install conan and run cmake configure. 
- `./scripts/run.sh` to build and run the program.
